# 《Spring》



​     Hope, hope, the east wind is coming, and the pace of spring is approaching.



​     Everything looks like they just awake up and they open their eyes joyfully. The mountains are moist, the water is growing, and the sun is blushing.



​     The grass sneaks out of the soil, tender and green. In the garden, in the field, look, there are lots of them. Sit down, lie down, play two rolls, kick a few balls, play a few runs, and catch a few hide-and-seek games. The wind is soft and the grass is soft.



​      Peach trees, apricot trees, pear trees, you won't let me, I won't let you, they are all full of flowers. Red like fire, pink like rosy clouds, white like snow. The flowers have a sweet taste. When you close your eyes, the tree seems to be full of peaches, apricots and pears. Thousands of bees buzzed under the flowers, and butterflies of all sizes flew around. Wild flowers are everywhere: miscellaneous, named, nameless, scattered in the flowers, like eyes, like stars, but also blinking.



​      "The wind is not cold on the face." Yes, it's like a mother's hand touching you. The wind brings the smell of freshly turned soil, mixed with the smell of grass, and the fragrance of various flowers, which are brewing in the slightly moist air. The birds put their nests in the flowers and leaves, and were happy. They showed off their crisp throats and sang melodies in harmony with the breeze and water. The piccolo of the shepherd boy on the back of the cow is also loud and clear all day.



​      Rain is the most common. It lasts for three or two days. Don't be upset. Look, it looks like cow hair, flower needles, and fine silk, which are tightly and diagonally woven. There is a thin layer of smoke on the roof of the house. The leaves of the trees are bright green, and the grass is green enough to make your eyes. In the evening, the light was on, and a little yellow light set off a quiet and peaceful night. In the countryside, on the path, beside the stone bridge, people holding umbrellas walk slowly; There are also farmers working in the fields, wearing coir raincoats and bamboo hats. Their thatched hut, sparse and sparse, was silent in the rain.



​      There are more kites in the sky and more children on the ground. In the city and countryside, every family, old and small, came out one by one. Relax your muscles and bones, be energetic, and do your own work. "The plan of the year is spring"; At the beginning, there is time and hope.



​      Spring is like a baby that just landed. It is new from head to foot. It grows.



​      Spring is like a little girl, blooming, smiling and walking.



​      Spring is like a robust youth, with iron arms, waist and feet, leading us forward.
